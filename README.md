# 📊 Clickstream Project

This project analyzes user clickstream data to extract meaningful insights into user behavior, website performance, and navigation patterns. It includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), session tracking, funnel analysis, and potential machine learning applications.

## 📁 Project Structure

```
Clickstream_Project.ipynb      # Jupyter notebook with all analysis
```

## 🧠 Features

- **Data Cleaning**  
  Handling missing values, formatting timestamps, and preparing clickstream logs.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  Understand user flow, common paths, and drop-off points.

- **Sessionization**  
  Grouping clicks by user and session to study behavioral patterns.

- **Conversion Funnel**  
  Visualization of drop-offs at each stage of the funnel.

- **Optional: Machine Learning**  
  Predict user churn or likelihood of conversion using classification models (if applicable).

## 📌 Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook.
2. Make sure all dependencies are installed (see below).
3. Run the notebook in Jupyter or VSCode.

## 🧰 Requirements

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

If time or location features are used:
```bash
pip install datetime
```

## 📈 Visualizations

The notebook contains the following plots:
- Heatmaps of user paths
- Funnel drop-off visualization
- Session duration histograms
- Possibly model evaluation metrics (ROC, confusion matrix)

## 📌 Future Work

- Implement predictive modeling to identify high-converting users.
- Real-time session monitoring dashboard.
- Integrate with tools like Google Analytics API.
